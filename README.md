GettingCleaningData
===================
The data used in this assignment is from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" [1].

Only the training and testing datasets were used in this assignment.  The inertial signals data were not used.

The run_analysis.R script contains all of the R code for creating a new tidyData dataset.
